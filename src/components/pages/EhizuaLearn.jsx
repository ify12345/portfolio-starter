       <p>
       Ehizua Learn is an online learning platform in progress that bridges the gap between educators and students. This platform, built with the latest technologies including React and Tailwind CSS,Node js offers a seamless and intuitive interface for teachers, students, and administrators.
       User experience was quite critical for a learning platform so I got a professional to whip up a new identity and mockups, drafted a proposal, based on that I built the design system and a brand new marketing site following those guidelines.
       <p>
         I worked  with a team of Ui designers to implement the Ui of this platform which is in progress
         My job was to implement the front End of this design using React here is a sneak peak to the figma  <a className='text-sm text-blue-600' href="https://www.figma.com/file/8QVFPKcHXSD9TytL4iNlzW/EHIZUA?type=design&node-id=4-186&mode=design&t=fYK7eW1MvH79TPoq-0">designs</a></p>
